# SpideyPC_low_volume
The Spider-Man 2000 PC port has some issues on modern computers, one of them is the audio system. The game is very loud and tabbing out will make you permanently lose control of the game, so there is no way to lower the game volume in the Sound Mixer. 
This little script solve this problem by automatically changing the volume of the game after booting it up.
